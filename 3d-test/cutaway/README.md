# cutaway

A Claude Code skill that turns one picture into a 3D object that takes itself apart.

Give Claude an image of a robotic animal, a machine or a device. It rebuilds it in three.js, every shell, gear and fang written as code, checks the build against the picture line by line, and films it: a cursor presses a button, that part comes apart under its own camera, then the whole object explodes and snaps back together.

## Install

```
npx skills add Nyxera0x/cutaway -g -a claude-code
```

Then, once, in the installed folder:

```
npm install && npx playwright install chromium
```

You need Node.js 20 or newer. For the video you also need `ffmpeg`, and for the sound Python 3.

## Use

Give Claude Code a picture and ask in plain words:

> Here is a robotic mantis. Build it as a 3D object I can take apart, and stop at the still so I can check it.

> Turn this image of a robot crab into a 20-second film where every part comes apart.

> I approved the still. Film it the way the piranha example is filmed.

No picture yet? `docs/PROMPTS.md` has the prompt that generated ours.

Or open one of the 3 examples first:

```
node sims/build.mjs tarantula-film     # cutaway-out/dist/tarantula-film.html
node sims/build.mjs piranha-film
node sims/build.mjs wasp-film
```

## How it works

1. **One reference picture** sets the look. Claude reads it and rebuilds it; it never imports it.
2. **A checklist for that picture**: 10 to 12 numbered lines Claude grades yes, partial or no every round.
3. **Measured, not eyeballed**: the share of dark mechanism and the proportions, both against the picture.
4. **A still first.** Claude stops after round 2 and waits for your yes. Nothing gets filmed before it.
5. **The film** reuses the example with the closest body 1:1 and changes the body only. Every part gets its own camera.
6. **A 10-second version** gets its own script, its own opening and its own exit.

The whole method is in `docs/`, written so you can follow it with or without the code.

## What is inside

| | |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | What Claude reads: the order of work, the rules that make it look right, the review loop. |
| `docs/JOB_DESCRIPTION.md` | The brief Claude reads before every object. Your corrections go into it. |
| `docs/CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/PROMPTS.md`, `docs/LESSONS.md` | The checklist format with a full example, every prompt, every mistake and the line it added. |
| `sims/tarantula-*`, `sims/piranha-*`, `sims/wasp-*` | 3 complete objects. `-shared` is the object, `-film` the full film, `-demo` the 10-second version. |
| `sims/green/` | The page around every object and the green look, plus 3 review tools: leftover-colour probe, camera track, part anchors. |
| `sims/kit/` | Runtime, stage, shader warm-up. |
| `sims/build.mjs` | Bundles an object into one HTML file, three.js and fonts inlined. |
| `sims/capture.mjs` | Renders the film frame by frame to a 60 fps mp4, or to review sheets of stills. |
| `sfx/`, `run_sfx.py` | Procedural sound on the film's timeline, mastered to −14 LUFS. |
